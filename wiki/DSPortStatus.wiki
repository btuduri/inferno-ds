Inferno kernels can be [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/downloads/list downloaded] and booted. 

The working devices that are used by limbo programs are:
  * input: buttons and touch screen
  * lcd screens: lower and upper (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/screen.c screen.c])
  * sound: play .iaf with pcm encoded files (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/devaudio.c devaudio.c])
  * storage: use devroot (consumes precious ram) or instead use sd card (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/devdldi.c devdldi.c])

luckily, there is enough work to be done!

See below & [GsocProjectIdeas] for some of the port goals,
also take a peek at [TechnicalBackground] to see the what the hardware provides.

= todo =

some short-term todo's (work in progress):
  
  # wifi: ap scan, stats and tx working (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/ethernds.c ethernds.c])
  # properly update the screen, to remove pixel corruption.
  # alternatives to access both screens with the existing input.
  # polish more sharp edges:  memory protection, cache management (jit) ...
