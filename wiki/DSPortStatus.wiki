= status =

inferno kernels can be booted.  buttons are working, the touch screen is working, both lcd screens work (though the upper one doesn't do anything useful).  dis programs can be run.

luckily, there is enough work to be done!

See below & [GsocProjectIdeas] for some of the port goals,
also take a peek at [TechnicalBackground] and compare it with the code.

= todo _(a lot)_=

some short-term todo's:

  * determine how best to use the two screens.
  * properly update framebuffer, to remove pixel corruption.
  * polish more sharp edges:  memory protection, cache management (jit) ...

a few bigger things left to do (work in progress):
  
  * storage: using devroot (consumes precious ram) instead use sd card (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/devdldi.c devdldi.c])
  * wifi: ap scan, stats and tx working (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/ethernds.c ethernds.c])
  * sound: can play .iaf with pcm encoded files (see [http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/devaudio.c devaudio.c])
