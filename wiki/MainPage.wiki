* Get LCD working
* Set up styx server on the arm7 to serve those devices, start with touchpad support(inferno * kernel instead?, display on shared memory? this sounds obnoxious and painful.)
* get wifi working
* get sound and microphone working(this is last, if I get everything else working by the due date I'll do this).
